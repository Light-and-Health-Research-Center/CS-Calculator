# CS-Calculator 2.0

The CS Calculator 2.0 is an open source web application tool that empowers lighting professionals to select light sources and light levels that will increase the potential for circadian-effective light exposure in architectural spaces, utilizing the CS metric. Provide the calculator with spectral power distribution (SPD) and illuminance data about your source(s) and recieve combined metrics, charts, and SPD's in return.
