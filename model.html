              <h3>Note 1: Instrument calibration for CL<sub>A</sub></h3>

              <p>
                The revised model (Rea et al., 2021a,b) involved optimization of
                the CLA spectral sensitivity framework, and was designed to (a)
                maintain the relationship between CS and predicted nocturnal
                melatonin suppression (e.g., CS of 0.5 results in 50% nocturnal
                melatonin suppression following a reference light exposure
                duration of 1 hour ) and to (b) maintain the original model
                coefficients (Rea et al., 2005) from the CS operating
                characteristic. In the original model, 1000 lux of CIE
                Illuminant A resulted in a CLA = 1000. In the revised model, a
                photopic illuminance of 1000 lux from CIE Illuminant A
                (approximately that of an incandescent lamp operated at 2856 K)
                results in a CLA 2.0 = 813. The value of 813 CLA 2.0 should be
                used by those wishing to calibrate instrumentation designed to
                report CLA 2.0 and CS. CLA 2.0 values can still be used to
                approximate the photopic illuminance, in lux, from a nonspecific
                "white" light source. For comparison, CLA 2.0 values should be
                multiplied by 1.23 to estimate the equivalent photopic
                illuminance from CIE Illuminant A, or by 0.66 to estimate the
                equivalent photopic illuminance from CIE Illuminant D65 (an
                approximation of daylight with a correlated color temperature of
                6500 K).

              <h3>Note 2: Photoreceptor fundamentals</h3>

              <p>
                For the revised model (Rea et al. 2021a,b), the optimization of
                spectral sensitivity was performed using fundamentals that
                differed slightly from those recommended in CIE S 026 (CIE
                2015a,b) for S-cone and melanopsin. Using the CIE S-cone
                fundamental for the optimization had negligible effect on the
                accuracy of predictions for both broadband and narrowband light
                sources. To characterize the action spectrum for melanopsin, we
                used the template published by Wyszecki and Stiles (1982) with
                an in vivo (filtered by the crystalline lens) peak sensitivity
                at 485 nm and a half-maxim sensitivity of 89 nm. The CIE on the
                other hand used the template from Govardovskii et al. (2000)
                with a peak sensitivity of 490 nm and a half-maximum sensitivity
                of 84 nm. Using the CIE melanopsin template for the model
                optimization did not affect the optimization process for
                broadband sources, however, the prediction accuracy for
                narrowband sources was significantly worse. Thus, the Wyszecki
                and Stiles (1982) template appears to be better than that from
                Govardovskii et al. (2000) in characterizing the in vivo action
                spectrum of melanopsin. The revised model indirectly tests the
                utility of the CIE S 026 melanopic function for modeling the
                spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system.

              <h3>Note 3: Photoreceptor action spectra normalization</h3>

              <p>
                The four photoreceptor action spectra in the CLA equation (M(λ),
                V(λ), V’(λ) and S-cone(λ)) are all unitless weighting functions,
                each normalized to have a maximum value of 1. These action
                spectra represent in-vivo photoreceptor spectral sensitivities
                including the effects of preretinal filtering by the eye (e.g.,
                lens absorption). Thus, the CIE photopic and scotopic luminous
                efficiency functions (V(λ) and V’(λ), can be used to represent
                the spectral sensitivity of the L-cone + M-cone achromatic
                channel and rod achromatic channel, respectively. However, after
                adjusting the 480 nm opsin response representing melanopsin for
                lens transmission and removing macular pigment filtering from
                the S-cone fundamental, these photoreceptor action spectra
                needed to be renormalized to have a maximum value of 1.0.
